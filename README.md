# Isolated Palm Leaf Classification Benchmark

## Overview

Welcome to the Isolated Palm Leaf Classification Benchmark! This project aims to improve the classification of isolated palm leaf images using various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. Leveraging the strengths of models like VGG, ResNet, Efficient ViT, Swin, and CvT, we present a framework for enhancing classification accuracy and efficiency.

## Project Goals

- **Develop a Benchmark:** Establish a standard benchmark for isolated palm leaf classification.
- **Compare Architectures:** Evaluate and compare the performance of different neural network architectures.
- **Improve Classification:** Utilize advanced techniques to enhance classification accuracy.

## Datasets

We employ a curated dataset of isolated palm leaf images, consisting of multiple species. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

## Models

1. **VGG (Visual Geometry Group)**
   - Classic architecture known for simplicity and depth.
  
2. **ResNet (Residual Networks)**
   - Introduces skip connections for deeper networks without vanishing gradients.

3. **Efficient ViT (Vision Transformer)**
   - Combines convolutional layers with transformer architecture.

4. **Swin Transformer**
   - A hierarchical transformer that processes images at various scales.

5. **CvT (Convolutional Vision Transformer)**
   - Hybrid model that incorporates convolutional layers with transformer architecture.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy:** Proportion of correctly classified images.
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
